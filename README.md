# IMSure_Insurance_Management_System
This project's primary focus is managing insurance policies through a Python Django-based online system. It provides an overview of various policy categories and their details and facilitates client records management. The project is structured into two main sections: Customer and Admin Panel. Upon registering, users can access the system where they initially view available insurance coverage. The application process involves user submissions, with each requiring approval or disapproval from the administrator. By default, all applications are marked as pending. Furthermore, customers can review policy history, submit inquiries, and view responses from the admin within this online application.
